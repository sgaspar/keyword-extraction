<p id="id01359">Experiment 134.—Weigh accurately, using delicate balances, 5 g.
KClO3, and mix with the crystals 1 or 2 g. of pure powdered MnO2.
Put the mixture into a t.t. with a tight-fitting cork and
delivery-tube, and invert over the water-pan, to collect the gas,
a flask of at least one and a half liters' capacity, filled with
water. Apply heat, and, without rejecting any of the gas, collect
it as long as any will separate.</p>

<p id="id01360">Then press the flask down into the water till the level in the
flask is the same as that outside, and remove the flask, leaving
in the bottom all the water that is not displaced. Weigh the
flask with the water it contains; then completely fill it with
water and weigh again.</p>

<p id="id01361">Subtract the first weight from the second, and the result will
evidently be the weight of water that occupies the same volume as
the O collected. This weight, if expressed in grams, represents
approximately the number of cubic centimeters of water,—since 1
cc. of water weighs lg,—or the number of cubic centimeters of O.</p>

<p id="id01362">At the time the experiment is performed the temperature should be
noted with a centigrade thermometer, and the atmospheric pressure
with a barometer graduated to millimeters.</p>

<p id="id01363">Suppose that we have obtained 1450 cc. of O, that the temperature
is 27 degrees, and the pressure 758 mm.; we wish to find the
volume and the weight of the gas at 0 degrees and 760 mm.</p>

<p id="id01364">According to the law of Charles—the volume of a given quantity
of gas at constant pressure varies directly as the absolute
temperature. To reduce from the centigrade to the absolute scale,
we have only to add 273 degrees. Adding the observed temperature,
we have 273 degrees + 27 degrees = 300 degrees. Applying the
above law to O obtained at 300 degrees A, we have the proportion
below. Since the volume of O at 273 degrees will be less than it
will at 300 degrees, the fourth term, or answer will be less than
the third, and the second term must be less than the first. 300 :
273 :: 1450 : x. This would give the result dependent upon
temperature alone.</p>

<p id="id01365">By the law of Mariotte - Physics, - the volume of a given
quantity of gas at a constant temperature varies inversely as the
pressure. Applying this law to the O obtained at 758mm, we have
the following proportion. The volume at 760mm will be less than
at 758mm; or the fourth term will be less than the third; hence
the second must be less than the first. 760: 758:: 1450: x. This
would give the result dependent on pressure alone.</p>

<p id="id01366">Combining the two proportions in one:—</p>

<p id="id01367" style="margin-right: 1%; margin-left: 1%">	300: 273 ):: 1450: x = 1316cc.
	760: 758 )</p>

<p id="id01368">1316cc=1.316 liters. It remains to find the weight of this gas. A liter of
H weighs 0.0896g. The vapor density of O is 16. Hence 1.316 liters of O
will weigh 1.316 X 16 X 0.0896 =1.89g.</p>

<p id="id01369">                    (KClO3 = KCl + O3)<br/>

From the equation   (122.5         48) we make a proportion,<br/>

                    (   5           x)<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01370">122.5: 5:: 48: x = 1.95, and obtain, as the weight of O contained in
5g of KClO3, 1.95g. The weight we actually,obtained was 1.89g. This
leaves an error of 0.06g, or a little over 4 per cent of error (0.06 / 1.95
= 0.03 +). The percentage of error, in performing this experiment,
should fall within 10.</p>

<p id="id01371">Some of the liabilities to error are as follows:—</p>

<p id="id01372" style="margin-top: 2em">1. Impure MnO2, which sometimes contains C. CO2 is soluble m H2O.</p>

<p id="id01373">2. Solubility of O in water.</p>

<p id="id01374">3. Escape of gas by leakage.</p>

<p id="id01375">4. Moisture taken up by the gas.</p>

<p id="id01376">5. Difference between the temperature of the gas and that of the
air in the room.</p>

<p id="id01377">6. Errors in weighing.</p>

<p id="id01378">7. Want of accuracy in the weights and scales.</p>

<p id="id01379">344. Hydrogen.</p>

<p id="id01380">Experiment 135.—Weigh 5g, or less of sheet or granulated Zn, and
put it into a small flask provided with a thistle-tube and a
delivery-tube. Cover the Zn with water, and introduce through the
thistle-tube measured quantities of HCl, a few cubic centimeters
at a time. Collect the H over water in large flasks, observing
the same directions as in removing O. Weigh the water, compute
the volume of the gas, reduce it to the standard, and obtain the
weight, as before. Should any Zn or other solid substance be
left, pour off the water or filter it, weigh the dry residue, and
deduct its weight from that of the Zn originally taken. Suppose
the residue to weigh 0.5g. Make and solve the proportion from the
equation:-</p>

<p id="id01381" style="margin-top: 2em">Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl2 + 2H.
65 	             2.
4.5	             x.</p>

<p id="id01382" style="margin-top: 2em">Compute the percentage of errcr, as in the case of O. If the
purity of the HCl be known, i.e. the weight of HCl gas in one
cubic centimeter of the liquid, a proportion can be made between
HCl and H, provided no free HCl is left in the flask. State any
liabilities to error in this experiment.</p>

<h5 id="id01383">PROBLEMS.</h5>

<p id="id01384">(1) A gas occupies 2000cc.when the barometer stands
750mm. What volume will it fill at 760mm?</p>

<p id="id01385">(2) At 750mm my volume of O is 4 1/2 liters. What will it be at
730mm?</p>

<p id="id01386">(3) At 825mm?</p>

<p id="id01387">(4) At 200mm?</p>

<p id="id01388">(5) Compute the volume of a gas at 70 degrees, which at 30
degrees is 150cc.</p>

<p id="id01389">(6) At 0 degrees I have 3000cc.of O. What volume will it occupy
at 100 degrees?</p>

<p id="id01390">(7) I fill a flask holding 2 litres with H. The thermometer
indicates 26 degrees, the barometer 762mm. What is the volume of
the gas at 0 degrees and 760mm?</p>

<p id="id01391">If the volumes of gases vary as above, it is evident that their
vapor densities must vary inversely. A liter of H at 0 degrees
weighs 0.0896. What will a liter of H weigh at 273 degrees? At
273 degrees the one liter has be- come two liters, one of which
weighs 0.0448 (= 0.0896 / 2). The vapor density of a gas is
inversely proportional to the temperature. Also, the vapor
density is directly proportional to the pressure, since a liter
of any gas under a pressure of one atmosphere is reduced to half
a liter under two atmospheres.</p>

<h5 id="id01392">PROBLEMS.</h5>

<p id="id01393">(1) Find the weight of a liter of O at 0 degrees; then compute the
weight of a liter at 27  degrees.</p>

<p id="id01394">(2) Find the weight of 500cc.of N2O at 60 degrees.</p>

<p id="id01395">(3) Of 200 cc. of CO at -5 degrees.</p>

<p id="id01396">(4) A given volume of O weighs 0.25g at a pressure of 750mm; find
the weight of a like volume of O at 758mm.</p>

<h3 id="id01424" style="margin-top: 3em">INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE</h3>

<p id="id01425">By R.P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in Chemistry in the English High
School, Boston. l2mo. Cloth. 216 pages. By mail, 90 cents; for
introduction, 80 cents.</p>

<p id="id01426">This work is strictly, but easily, inductive. The pupil is
stimulated by query and suggestion to observe important
phenomena, and to draw correct conclusions. The experiments are
illustrative, the apparatus is simple and easily made. The
nomenclature, symbols, and writing of equations are made
prominent features. In descriptive and theoretical chemistry, the
arrangement of subjects is believed to be especially superior in
that it presents, not a mere aggregation of facts, but the
science of chemistry. Brevity aud concentration, induction,
clearness, accuracy, and a legitimate regard for interest, are
leading characteristics. The treatment is full enough for any
high school or academy.</p>

<p id="id01427">Though the method is an advanced one, it has been so simplified
that pupils experience no difficulty, but rather an added
interest, in following it.</p>

<p id="id01428">The author himself has successfully employed this method in
classes so large that the simplest and most practical plan has
been a necessity.</p>

<p id="id01429">Thomas C. Van Nuys, Professor of Chemistry, Indiana University,<br/>

Bloomington, Ind.:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01430">"I consider it an excellent work for students entering upon the
study of chemistry."</p>

<p id="id01431">C.F. Adams, Teacher of Science, High School, Detroit, Mich.:</p>

<p id="id01432">"I have carried two classes through Williams's Chemistry. The
book has surpassed my highest expectations. It gives greater
satisfaction with each succeeding class."</p>

<p id="id01433">J.W. Simmons, County Superintendent of Schools, Owosso, Mich.:</p>

<p id="id01434">"The proof of the merits of a textbook, is found in the crucible
of the class-room work. There are many chemistries, and good
ones; but, for our use, this leads them all. It is stated in
language plain, interesting and not misleading. A logical order
is followed, and the mind of the student is at work because of
the many suggestions offered. We use Williams's work, and the
results are all we could wish. There is plenty of chemistry in
the work for any of our high schools."</p>

<p id="id01435">W.J. Martin, Professor of Chemistry, Davidson College, N.C.:</p>

<p id="id01436">"One of the most admirable little text-books I have ever seen."</p>

<p id="id01437">T.H. Norton, Projessor of Chemistry, Cincinnati University, O.:</p>

<p id="id01438">"Its clearness, accuracy, and compact form render it
exceptionally well adapted for use in high and preparatory
schools. I shall warmly recommend it for use, whenever the effort
is made to provide satisfactory training in accordance with the
requirements for admission to the scientific courses of the
University."</p>

<h4 id="id01439" style="margin-top: 2em">CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS</h4>

<p id="id01440" style="margin-top: 2em">General and Analytical. By R.P. WILLIAMS, Instructor in
Chemistry, English High School, Boston. 8vo. Boards. xv + 212
pages. Fully illustrated. Mailing price, 60 cents; for
introduction, 50 cents.</p>

<p id="id01441">This book is for the use of students in the chemical laboratory.<br/>

It contains more than one hundred sets of the choicest<br/>

illustrative experiments, about half of which belong to General<br/>

Chemistry, the rest to Metal and Acid Analysis.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01442">Great care has been taken to describe accurately and minutely the
methods of performing experiments, and in directing pupils to
observe phenomena and to explain what is seen. The work is amply
illustrated and is replete with questions and suggestions. Blank
pages are inserted for pupils to make a record of their work, for
which careful directions are given, with a model, laboratory
rules, tables of solubilities, etc.</p>

<p id="id01443">A new feature is the supplementary and original work, vhich is
given at the end of each set of experiments for such pupils as
complete the prescribed work ahead of others in the class, and a
list of terms to be looked up in some text-book. This gives an
elasticity to the book and fits it for use in schools where much
time is devoted to chemistry, as well as in the most elementary
classes in labortttory work.</p>

<p id="id01444">Another original feature which it is believed will be heartily
welcomed by teachers is the method of treating Metal Analysis
successfully used by the author for several years.</p>

<p id="id01445">Briefly, the aim of this book is to aid the pupil to do, to
observe, to explain, to record, aud thus to learn the essentials
of chemistry.</p>

<p id="id01468" style="margin-top: 2em">Including Uranography. Revised Edition. By CHARLES A. YOUNG,<br/>

Professor of Astronomy in the College of New Jersey. 12mo. Cloth.<br/>

Illustrated. ix + 357 pages, exclusive of four double-page star<br/>

maps. By mail, $1.30; for introduction, $1.20.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01469">The revised edition of this book has been prepared for schools
that desire a brief course free from mathematics. It is based
upon the author's Elements of Astronomy, but many changes of
arrangement have been made. In fact, everything has been
carefully worked over and re-written to adapt it to the special
requirements. Great pains has been taken not to sacrifice
accuracy and truth to brevity, and no less to bring everything
thoroughly down to date. The latest results of astronomical
investigation will be found here. The author has endeavored, too,
while discarding mathematics, to give the student a clear
understanding and a good grasp of the subject. As a body of
information and as a means of discipline, this book will be
found, it is believed, of notable value. The most important
change in the arrangement of the book has been in bringing the
Uranography, or constellation tracing, into the body of the text
and placing it near the beginning, a change in harmony with the
accepted principle that those whose minds are not mature succeed
best in the study of a new subject by beginning with what is
concrete and appeals to the senses, rather than with the abstract
principles. Brief notes on the legendary mythology of the
constellations have been added for the benefit of such pupils as
are not likely to become familiar with it in the study of
classical literature.</p>

<p id="id01471">"I shall take pleasure in commending it to schools requiring an
astronomy of this grade. The whole series of Astronomies reflects
credit on their distinguished author and shows that he
appreciates the needs of the schools."</p>

<p id="id01472">Clarence E. Kelly, Prin. of High School, Haverhill, Mass.:</p>

<p id="id01473">"It seems to me the book is admirably adapted to its purpose, and
that it accomplishes the difficult task of presenting to the
student or reader not conversant with Algebra and Geometry, an
excellent selection of what may with profit be given him as an
introduction to the science of astronomy."</p>

had every presumption in its favor, and the event has more than
justified expectations. Special attention has been paid to making
all statements correct and accurate so far as they go.</p>

<p id="id01479">In the text no mathematics higher than elementary algebra and
geometry is introduced; in the foot-notes and in the Appendix an
occasional trigonometric formula appears, for the benefit of the
very considerable number of High school students who understand

<p id="id01499">The eminence of Professor Young as an original investigator in
astronomy, a lecturer and writer on the subject, and an
instructor of college classes, and his scrupulous care in
preparing this volume, led the publishers to present the work
with the highest confidence; and this confidence has been fully
justified by the event. More than one hundred colleges adopted
the work within a year from its publication, and it is conceded
to be the best astronomical text-book of its grade to be found
anywhere.</p>

<p id="id01540">This work is a complete popular exposition of the molecular
theory of matter, as it is held by the leading physicists of
today. Considerable space is devoted to the kinetic theory of
gases. Liquids also are discussed, and solids receive much
attention. There is also a division discussing the methods that
have been proposed for finding the sizes of molecules, and here,
as elsewhere throughout the book, the methods described are
illustrated by numerical examples. The last division of the book
touches upon the constitution of molecules. The subject is
everywhere treated from a physical standpoint.</p>
